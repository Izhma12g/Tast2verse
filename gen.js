        ingredients: [
            "2kg pork shoulder",
            "3 tablespoons olive oil",
            "2 tablespoons smoked paprika",
            "1 tablespoon ground cumin",
            "1 tablespoon brown sugar",
            "1 teaspoon ground mustard",
            "1 teaspoon cayenne pepper",
            "Salt and black pepper",
            "2 large onions, finely sliced",
            "4 cloves garlic, minced",
            "1 cup BBQ sauce",
            "2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce",
            "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar",
            "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard",
            "1/2 cup chicken stock or water",

            "Butter for toasting buns"
        ],
        steps: `Start by preparing your pork shoulder. Preheat your oven to 160°C (320°F). Pat the pork shoulder dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture, then rub it generously with olive oil. In a small bowl, combine the smoked paprika, ground cumin, brown sugar, ground mustard, cayenne pepper, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Massage this spice blend all over the pork, ensuring that every crevice is well-coated. The spices will form a crust that infuses the meat with flavour as it cooks. <br><br>Heat a large, heavy-based pan (a cast iron skillet is perfect) over medium-high heat. Once hot, carefully place the pork shoulder in the pan and sear it on all sides. This step is essential—it caramelises the outside of the pork, locking in the juices and giving it a rich, golden-brown colour. Take your time here; you want each side of the pork to develop a deep, toasty crust. Once browned, transfer the pork to a large roasting tray, setting it aside for now. <br><br>In the same pan, add a little more olive oil if needed, then toss in the sliced onions. Sauté them slowly, stirring occasionally until they become soft, translucent, and start to caramelise, about 10-15 minutes. Once the onions are golden and sweet, add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute until fragrant. <br><br>Now, pour in the BBQ sauce, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, and chicken stock (or water). Stir everything together, scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan—that's where a lot of the flavour lies! Bring the mixture to a simmer, then pour it all over the pork shoulder in the roasting tray, making sure the pork is well-coated with the sauce. Cover the roasting tray tightly with foil, sealing in all the moisture to create a steamy environment for the pork to tenderise. <br><br>Place the tray in the preheated oven and roast for 3-4 hours, checking periodically. The slow cooking process is key to breaking down the pork's tough fibres, resulting in meat that’s incredibly tender and juicy. You’ll know it’s ready when the pork can be easily pulled apart with a fork. <br><br>Once your pork is beautifully cooked and tender, carefully remove it from the oven and allow it to rest for 15 minutes. This resting period helps the juices redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring every bite is succulent. Using two forks, shred the pork directly in the roasting tray, mixing it with the rich BBQ sauce that has gathered at the bottom. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of water or chicken stock to loosen it, making sure each piece of pork is coated in that smoky, tangy goodness. <br><br>Now it's time to prepare your burger buns! Slice the buns in half and butter the cut sides. Heat a pan or griddle over medium heat and toast the buns, butter-side down, until golden and crispy. This not only adds flavour but also helps prevent the buns from becoming soggy when filled with the juicy pork. <br><br>To assemble your burgers, start by layering a generous portion of the pulled pork onto the bottom half of each bun. If you’re feeling indulgent, add a slice of sharp cheddar cheese on top of the pork for a creamy contrast. Next, pile on a handful of crunchy coleslaw, which adds freshness and a nice contrast to the smoky richness of the pork. Finally, add a few slices of pickles and jalapeños (if you like a bit of heat) before placing the top half of the bun in place. <br><br>Serve the BBQ Pulled Pork Burgers with extra BBQ sauce on the side and a side of crispy fries or onion rings for the ultimate BBQ feast. With each bite, you'll get a perfect balance of smoky, tangy, and savoury flavours, all wrapped up in a soft, buttery bun. Enjoy this messy, delicious masterpiece with friends or family at your next gathering! `

        title: "Authentic Italian Pizza",
        image: "img/Pizza.jpg",
        ingredients: [
            "500g all-purpose flour",
            "325ml warm water",
            "1 packet active dry yeast",
            "1 teaspoon sugar",
            "2 teaspoons salt",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "200g Sliced mozzarella cheese",
            "150g tomato sauce",
            "Fresh basil leaves",
            "1 teaspoon oregano",
            "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
            "100g sliced pepperoni",
            "100Kg Pinaepple slices",
            "100g sliced mushrooms"
        ],
        steps: `Making authentic Italian pizza is a delightful and rewarding experience, perfect for bringing a touch of Italy into your home. Begin by combining the warm water and sugar in a small bowl, then sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit for about 10 minutes until frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Create a well in the centre and pour in the yeast mixture along with the olive oil. Stir until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size. <br><br>Once the dough has risen, preheat your oven to its highest setting, ideally around 250°C (480°F). Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal parts. Roll each part into a ball and let them rest for another 10 minutes. On a floured surface, roll out one of the dough balls into a thin circle, about 30cm (12 inches) in diameter. Transfer the dough to a baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the oregano and garlic powder evenly over the sauce. Arrange the mozzarella cheese slices on top, followed by any additional toppings you desire, such as pepperoni or fresh basil leaves. <br><br>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is beautifully golden and the cheese is bubbling and lightly browned. If you're using a pizza stone, the baking time might be a little shorter due to the even distribution of heat. Keep an eye on it to avoid burning. Once baked to perfection, carefully remove the pizza from the oven and allow it to cool for a minute or two to let the cheese set slightly, making it easier to slice. <br><br>Before serving, you can add an extra touch of flavour by garnishing the pizza with fresh basil leaves, a drizzle of high-quality olive oil, or a sprinkle of chilli flakes for a bit of heat. For a truly authentic Italian experience, pair your pizza with a simple green salad and a glass of your favourite wine. Repeat the rolling, topping, and baking process with the second dough ball. <br><br>Now, enjoy your delicious homemade authentic Italian pizza, savouring each bite of the crispy crust, rich tomato sauce, and melted mozzarella cheese! Buon appetito! `,

            image: "img/Turkey.jpg",
            ingredients: [
                "5kg whole turkey",
                "4 tablespoons olive oil",
                "2 tablespoons butter",
                "2 teaspoons dried thyme",
                "2 teaspoons dried rosemary",
                "1 tablespoon garlic powder",
                "1 tablespoon onion powder",
                "1 teaspoon paprika",
                "Salt and black pepper",
                "2 onions, quartered",
                "4 carrots, roughly chopped",
                "3 celery stalks, roughly chopped",
                "1 lemon, halved",
                "1 bunch fresh parsley",
                "500ml chicken stock",
                "250ml white wine",
                "2 tablespoons flour (for gravy)"
            ],
            steps: `Begin your roast turkey adventure by preparing the bird for its flavour journey. Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Ensure your turkey is fully thawed, then pat it dry with paper towels inside and out. This step is key for ensuring that deliciously crisp skin. <br><br>In a small bowl, mix together olive oil, melted butter, thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper to create a flavour-packed rub. Carefully lift the skin over the turkey breast and massage half of the rub directly onto the meat under the skin. This will infuse the turkey with flavour from within, ensuring each bite is juicy and aromatic. Now, rub the remaining mixture all over the turkey's skin, paying special attention to the wings and legs. Let this sit for a few minutes to let the flavours meld. <br><br>Stuff the turkey cavity with a mix of quartered onions, chopped carrots, celery, halved lemon, and a handful of fresh parsley. These aromatic vegetables will steam inside the bird as it roasts, adding moisture and enhancing the flavour of the meat. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also add a few garlic cloves or sprigs of fresh thyme or rosemary. Tie the turkey legs together with kitchen twine to ensure even cooking, and tuck the wings under the bird to prevent them from burning. <br><br>Next, place the turkey breast-side up in a large roasting pan, making sure it’s sitting on a bed of the remaining chopped onions, carrots, and celery. This vegetable base will not only prevent the turkey from sticking to the pan but will also contribute to the rich, savoury gravy you'll make later. Pour the chicken stock and white wine into the bottom of the pan. This will create steam during the roasting process, keeping the turkey moist and adding depth to your gravy. <br><br>Cover the turkey loosely with aluminium foil to prevent the skin from browning too quickly. Place the turkey in the preheated oven and roast for about 3 to 4 hours, depending on the size of your bird (around 20 minutes per 500g). Every 30-40 minutes, baste the turkey with the juices that collect at the bottom of the pan. Basting helps the skin to crisp up and ensures the turkey stays moist. If you notice the skin browning too quickly, keep the foil on a little longer before removing it to let the skin crisp during the final hour of cooking. <br><br>About 30 minutes before the turkey is done, remove the foil to let the skin turn a gorgeous golden brown. The turkey is ready when the internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F) in the thickest part of the thigh. To check, insert a meat thermometer into the thigh without touching the bone. Once it’s cooked to perfection, remove the turkey from the oven and allow it to rest for 20-30 minutes. Resting is crucial as it allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, making each slice moist and flavourful. <br><br>While the turkey rests, you can prepare the gravy. Pour the drippings from the roasting pan into a saucepan, skimming off excess fat. Place the roasting pan over medium heat, sprinkle in the flour, and whisk constantly, scraping up the delicious browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Slowly add the reserved drippings back into the pan along with some extra chicken stock, stirring until the gravy thickens to your liking. Season with salt and pepper to taste. <br><br>Once your turkey has rested, carve it carefully, starting with the legs and thighs before moving to the breast. Serve with a generous drizzle of the homemade gravy, along with your favourite sides like roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes. Each bite will be a perfect balance of crispy skin, tender meat, and savoury flavours. Happy feasting! `
